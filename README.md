**In this example, the use of CRUD operations in the creation of a stock management system for a pharmacy is demonstrated.**

---
> In this example, it is seen the use of JDBC (Java DataBase
> Connectivity) in a CRUD (create, read, update, delete), using MySql
> database management system. With some changes this same code can be
> used in any case of use with relational database.
---
> This example was developed using CLI (comand line interface). But I
> aimed to keep the code as little tied to the CLI as possible, being
> possible to reuse this same algorithm in a use case with graphical
> interfaces applying observer project pattern and Java Swing or JavaFX.
